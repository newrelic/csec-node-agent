# New Relic Node.js security agent
[![npm status badge][1]][2] [![Security Agent CI][3]][4]

**Note**: The IAST capability should only be used in pre-production environments as the application is tested for real exploitable vulnerabilities.

The New Relic security agent is in preview and is not generally available. This module enables instrumentation of a Node.js application for interactive application security testing(IAST) and exposes exploitable vulnerabilities. 

## Installation

Typically, most users use the version auto-installed by the [New Relic Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic). You can see agent install instructions [here](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation-and-getting-started).

In some cases, installing a specific version is ideal. For example, new features or major changes might be released via a major version update to this module, prior to inclusion in the main New Relic Node.js Agent.

```sh
npm install @newrelic/security-agent@latest
```

For more information, please see New Relic Node.js agent [installation guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent/)

The `@newrelic/security-agent` must be explicitly enabled in order to perform IAST analysis of the application. In the newrelic.js, set the following parameters

```js
 /**
  * Security Configurations
  */
   security: {
    /**
     * enables/disables security agent functions and generation of events.
     */
    enabled: true,
    /**
      * To completely disable security, set agent.enabled flag to false. If the flag is set to false, the security module is not loaded. This property is read only once at application start.
      */
    agent: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
```

## Getting Started

The [Developer docs](http://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/) for writing instrumentation will be of help. We particularly recommend the [tutorials](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/tutorial-Instrumentation-Basics.html) and the [shim API](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/Shim.html) documentation.

## Testing

The module includes a suite of unit and functional tests which should be used to
verify that your changes don't break existing functionality.

All tests are stored in `tests/` and are written using
[Tap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tap) with the extension `.tap.js`.

To run the full suite, run: `npm test`.
